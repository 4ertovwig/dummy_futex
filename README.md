# dummy_futex
My old attempt at improving something in the main project

Just for fun.
Sources from the from glibc, musl were used, ulrich drapper's ideas and some internet resources.
The code contains links to the materials used.

Build docker image, run container, build unit tests and run unit tests:
    
    ./run_tests.sh
